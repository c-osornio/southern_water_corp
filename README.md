 **The Southern Water Corp Project: Statistics Analysis with Python**
---
The Southern Water Corp Project is a complex, challenging and real-world problem solving  project for doing financial, economics and statistics analyses. I've now converted all the analysis I did for Southern Water Corp using Excel into Python. I created visualizations using Seaborn, manipulated datasets with pandas, and so much more! 

Springboard data analytics bootcamp designed the statistical analysis project to give their students practice using Python to analyze datasets both large and small. I hope these skills help me apply throughout my career as a data analyst. Also, I would like to thank the springboard team for providing the awesome materials. 

**Intro**
---
Southern Water	Corp is	one of the largest desalination plants in Israel, retailing fresh, desalinated water for residential, public, and private consumption. They concerned the age of Surjek desalination plants because they noted signals around pumps that had provided abnormally high-pressure readings, indicative of system failure. I will do a statistical analysis for the Desalination Pump Failure dataset to understand what variables may drive an asset failure. 

I have indicated that by the end of this analysis, I would like:
   1. Identify a list of variables that may provide an indication of when the	pump may be failing. 
   2. Come up with a prototype linear equation that can be	 used to ‘describe’ what	variable are closely related	to pump failure.

This project has two parts:
- Descriptive Statistics
- Inferential Statistics
